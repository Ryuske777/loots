this is really so simple

# take router as WR300N

# take pcs and laptops

# in each pc and laptop --  change their network adapter to VMP300N -- and turn on
  for laptops -- WPC300N -- and you will se the connection between router and devices has established

# go to each device-- config -- wireless --  copy thier MAC address -- edit them by adding a  colon between them(har 2 char ke baad ek colon add kar dena taki mac filter slot me fit ho paye) -- and again copy them

# rl on router -- gui -- wireless -- mac filter -- enable the mac filter status -- and paste the copied mac address in the mac o1 slot 

# save changes

# now you will see the connection has been broken to the specific deivce -- done.
