# take some devices --- router [WRT300N], hubPT, 1841 router, smartphone PT, cell tower, central-office-sever , server PT

# the smartphone will be connected automatically to WRT300N and cell tower wirelessly

# use automatic cable to conncet the following devices --
  
   connect wrt300n to hubPT 
   connect hubPT to 1841 router
   1841 router to server pt (it will be dashed line connection)
   hubPT to central office sever
   connect cell tower to central office server (a zigzag line)

# everytihg will be connected except central office sever to the server PT direclty

# geometry -> at the left side there wil be smartphone and wt300n andl niche celltower
              at the middle side upar hub pt and niche central office sever
              at the right side upar router 1841 and niche serverPT

# there are total 2 networks 20.0.0.0 and 21.0.0.0

# rl on wr300n -- config -- internet -- select static --and give ip address as 20.0.0.2 and niche default gateway as 20.0.0.1

#  rl on router 1841 -- config -- fastethernet 0/0 give ip as 20.0.0.1 and click on
                                  fastethernet 0/1 give ip as 21.0.0.1 and click on

# rl on server pt -- config -- setting -- gateway/DNS IPv4 me default gateway 21.0.0.1 ye ip daalo
                               then fastehternet -- ip configuration me ipv4 address 21.0.0.2 ye daalo -- click on

# now you will see all the green dots there

# now try to send packet from smartphone pt to server pt [it may fail but try again]

# done
